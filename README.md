SOME OF MY SOLVED QUESTION USING C++ PROGRAMMING
# 🚀 MYOWNREPO

This repository contains some of my solved problems using **C++ programming**.  
All programs are written to practice and improve my coding skills.

## 📌 Programs included
- `palindrome.cpp` — Program to check whether the input number is a Palindrome.
- `armstrong.cpp` — Program to check whether the input number is a Armstrong.
- `prime.cpp` — Program to check whether the input number is a Prime.
- `palindromstrings.cpp` — Program to check whether the input string is a palindrome.
- `grammer.cpp` — Program to count the number of vowels, consonants, and words in the input string.
- `templatefunct.cpp` — Program to find the maximum of three values (int, double, float, char, string) using a function template.
- `passbyvalue.cpp` — Swap using pass by value. The original variables are **not** modified.
- `callbyaddress.cpp` — Swap using pointers (pass by address). The original variables **are** modified.
- `callbyreference.cpp` — Swap using references (pass by reference). The original variables **are** modified.
- `calculatorusingfunctionpointer.cpp` — Simple calculator program using function pointers and switch-case. Supports add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
- `pointerobjects.cpp` — Program demonstrating the use of pointers to objects in C++.Creates a Rectangle class with methods to calculate area, perimeter, and diagonal and Uses object pointers to access and operate on multiple Rectangle objects.
