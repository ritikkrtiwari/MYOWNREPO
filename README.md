SOME OF MY SOLVED QUESTION USING C++ PROGRAMMING
# üöÄ MYOWNREPO

This repository contains some of my solved problems using **C++ programming**.  
All programs are written to practice and improve my coding skills.

## üìå Programs included
- `palindrome.cpp` ‚Äî Program to check whether the input number is a Palindrome.
- `armstrong.cpp` ‚Äî Program to check whether the input number is a Armstrong.
- `prime.cpp` ‚Äî Program to check whether the input number is a Prime.
- `palindromstrings.cpp` ‚Äî Program to check whether the input string is a palindrome.
- `grammer.cpp` ‚Äî Program to count the number of vowels, consonants, and words in the input string.
- `templatefunct.cpp` ‚Äî Program to find the maximum of three values (int, double, float, char, string) using a function template.
- `passbyvalue.cpp` ‚Äî Swap using pass by value. The original variables are **not** modified.
- `callbyaddress.cpp` ‚Äî Swap using pointers (pass by address). The original variables **are** modified.
- `callbyreference.cpp` ‚Äî Swap using references (pass by reference). The original variables **are** modified.
- `calculatorusingfunctionpointer.cpp` ‚Äî Simple calculator program using function pointers and switch-case. Supports add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
- `pointerobjects.cpp` ‚Äî Program demonstrating the use of pointers to objects in C++.Creates a Rectangle class with methods to calculate area, perimeter, and diagonal and Uses object pointers to access and operate on multiple Rectangle objects.
- `dynapointerobject.cpp` ‚Äî Program demonstrating the use of dynamically allocated objects with pointers in C++.Creates a Rectangle class with methods to calculate area, perimeter, and diagonal.And Dynamically allocates three Rectangle objects on the heap, uses pointers to access them, and properly frees memory.
- `constructor.cpp` ‚Äì Program demonstrating constructor overloading in C++. It creates a Rectangle class with default constructor, parameterized constructor, and copy constructor. The program also shows how to set and get length/width and calculates area and perimeter.
- `scoperesolution.cpp` ‚Äì Program demonstrating constructor overloading and scope resolution operator in C++. Creates a Rectangle class with default, parameterized, and copy constructors. Includes methods to calculate area, perimeter, diagonal, and to check if the rectangle is a square.
- `deepcopyconstructor.cpp` ‚Äì Program demonstrating deep copy constructor in C++. Creates a Rectangle class that allocates memory dynamically for length on the heap, and uses a deep copy constructor to ensure new memory is allocated when copying objects.
- `copyconstructor.cpp` ‚Äì Program demonstrating default shallow copy constructor in C++. Creates a Rectangle class that allocates memory dynamically for length and shows how the shallow copy just copies the pointer (so both objects point to the same memory location).

To compile and run any program:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o outputname
./outputname
